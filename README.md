# README.md for personal website, right now used for CS50 sudoku project
*Website by Oscar Lee, Sudoku by Antony 1 group, Spring 2020*

## About
Website for hosting stuff by me. Right now used for visual display of a Sudoku program, created by CS50's Atony 1 group, Spring 2020.

## Implementation
The site runs php code, which executes shell scripts that run the Sudoku executable. Hopefully the sites functionality is intuitive enough. I tried to make it idiot proof too.

## Future fixes and changes to make the site better
Right now, the site doesn't support a large user base, since all users are sharing the same output file. Thus, two users may get different output. However, this could be an easy fix with more php and webdev knowledge.
